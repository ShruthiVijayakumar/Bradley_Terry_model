# Bradley_Terry_model
The Bradley-Terry model can be useful for predicting future outcomes even when teams or items have not directly competed against each other before. This capability arises from the model's ability to infer the relative strengths of teams based on their pairwise comparison data.

# Example Scenario
Assume we have historical data showing the results of games between several basketball teams. For instance:

Team A has beaten Team B.
Team B has beaten Team C.
Team C has beaten Team D.
Even though Team A and Team D have never played each other, the Bradley-Terry model can still predict the probability of Team A winning against Team D based on the estimated strengths of each team. Here's how it works:

Estimate Strength Parameters:

Based on the observed results, the model estimates the strength parameters for Teams A, B, C, and D.
Compute Probabilities:

Using these estimated strengths, the model computes the probability of Team A beating Team D by comparing their strength parameters. This computation takes into account the relative strengths inferred from the known pairwise comparisons.
